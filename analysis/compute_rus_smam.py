Compute female SMAM for Russia from the 2021 Census (VPN-2020)
Table 5: Population by age, sex, and marital status.

Uses the standard Hajnal (1953) formula on census counts of women
who have NEVER been married (никогда не состоявшие в браке, column 6)
as a proportion of those who stated marital status (column 2).

Note: the Russian census covers ages 16+, so the 15-19 age group is
approximated by combining the 16-17 and 18-19 rows. See "AGE-15 SENSITIVITY"
below for an explicit, falsifiable arithmetic bound on the resulting error
(replacing an earlier unsupported "<0.1 year" assertion).

AGE-15 SENSITIVITY BOUND (derived, not asserted):
  Hajnal's A = 15 + 5 * sum(p_g for g in the seven age groups). Only the
  15-19 term is affected by the age-16+ census coverage, and only through
  replacing the true 5-value average (p15, p16, p17, p18, p19) with the
  4-value average p1619 = mean(p16..p19) actually observed. The resulting
  error in that term is (1/5) * (p15 - p1619), so the error in A is
  (p15 - p1619), and since B, C, D (the 45-49 terms) are untouched, the
  resulting error in SMAM = (A - D) / C is approximately (p15 - p1619) / C.

  ASSUMPTION: |p15 - p1619| <= 0.02 (the proportion of 15-year-old women
  never married differs from the observed 16-19 average by at most 2
  percentage points). This is a conservative bound given Russia's legal
  minimum marriage age (18, or 16 by regional exception) makes marriage at
  15 a legal impossibility in nearly all cases, so both proportions should
  sit well above 0.95 with a gap far smaller than 2 points in practice.

  Under this assumption, with C = 1 - B typically in the 0.93-0.98 range for
  a SMAM near 24-25 (B is printed at runtime below, so this bound can be
  checked against the actual run), the resulting bound on the SMAM error is
  0.02 / C =~ 0.020-0.022 years -- roughly five times smaller than the
  previously claimed (but undemonstrated) 0.1-year threshold.
