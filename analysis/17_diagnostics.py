-----------------
Formal model diagnostics that justify the Part 2 specification choices.

Produces:
  (A) VIF (variance inflation factors) on the lagged covariates — multicollinearity.
      Reported THREE ways: pooled, between-country (country means), and
      within-country (deviations from country means). The between/within split
      explains why the CA coefficient is stable while individual between-country
      control coefficients are imprecise: the country means are highly collinear.

  (B) Mundlak test for FE vs RE — the formal justification for the between/within
      separation. Replaces the classical Hausman test, which is undefined here
      because Var(b_FE) - Var(b_RE) is not positive definite (see note in code).

  (C) Few-cluster caveat — 14 clusters is below the safe threshold, so
      cluster-robust SEs may be anti-conservative; wild-cluster bootstrap
      (script 19, section G) is the recommended robustness follow-up.
