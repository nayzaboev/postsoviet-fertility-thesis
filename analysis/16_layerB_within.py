-------------------
LAYER B — the within-country question: over time, inside a given country, what
moves fertility? This is the robustness defence against the spurious-regression
critique (the old pooled model had Durbin-Watson = 0.13).

Four estimators / descriptive checks:

  (A) TWO-WAY FIXED EFFECTS (country + year), via linearmodels.PanelOLS,
      clustered SE by country.
      NOTE: the Central Asia dummy and any time-invariant variable are ABSORBED
      by country effects and cannot be estimated here — that is expected, not a
      bug. Layer A (script 15) is where the CA premium lives.

  (B1) FIRST-DIFFERENCE model WITHOUT year effects: regress delta-TFR on
       delta-covariates. Reported as a sensitivity check.

  (B2) FIRST-DIFFERENCE model WITH year effects: same as B1 but includes
       year dummies after differencing. This absorbs common time shocks. If a
       coefficient is significant in B1 but not in B2, the estimate is SENSITIVE
       to the inclusion of common time controls (year effects). This is a
       statement about specification sensitivity, not proof that the B1 result
       was "caused by" common shocks.

  (C) DESCRIPTIVE PERSISTENCE CHECKS (not formal tests):
      - Average per-country ADF t-statistic ("t-bar") on TFR and each covariate.
        This is a descriptive summary of persistence, NOT the formal
        Im-Pesaran-Shin (IPS) panel unit-root test and does NOT establish an
        order of integration.
      - Descriptive AR(1) coefficient on the FE residuals. This summarises
        residual persistence; it is NOT the Wooldridge-Drukker panel
        serial-correlation test and does not by itself imply a unit root or a
        spurious regression.

remittances_gdp_pct_lag1, under5_mortality_lag1
