# Post-Soviet Fertility Thesis

**Title:** Fertility Trends in the Post-Soviet Space: A Comparative Analysis of Central Asia and Other Former Soviet Countries (2000–2023)

**Degree:** Master's Thesis — University of Bonn

**Author:** Shokhrukh Nayzaboev

**Repository:** https://github.com/nayzaboev/postsoviet-fertility-thesis

## Research Question

How have fertility trends evolved in Central Asia and other post-Soviet countries between 2000 and 2023, and what factors are associated with the persistence of comparatively higher fertility rates observed in Central Asia?

## Countries (n = 14)

The Central Asia group covers the **four Central Asian successor states with
sufficiently comparable data** (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan).
Turkmenistan, the fifth Central Asian successor state, is **excluded** — not for
convenience but because its official statistics are not comparable with the rest
of the sample:

| Issue | Evidence | Consequence for this study |
|---|---|---|
| Covariate coverage | World Bank WDI series used as controls (GDP-PPP, remittances % GDP, urbanisation, under-5 mortality) are missing or sparsely reported for Turkmenistan across 2000–2023 | Turkmenistan cannot enter the controlled panel (Part 2) on the same basis as the other 14 |
| Statistical transparency | Turkmenistan's demographic and economic reporting is widely regarded as opaque, with limited independent verification | Even the TFR series (Part 1) would not be comparably measured |
| Treatment in this thesis | Excluded from **all** analyses (Parts 1 and 2), not selectively | Scope is "four comparable Central Asian states", stated explicitly, rather than implying full coverage of the region |

Adding Turkmenistan merely to achieve nominal five-country coverage would import
non-comparable measurement into both the descriptive and the modelling parts;
the exclusion is therefore a deliberate scope decision, documented here.

- **Central Asia:** Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan
- **Eastern European:** Belarus, Moldova, Russia, Ukraine
- **Baltic:** Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania
- **Caucasus:** Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia

## Headline Result

The Central Asia fertility premium (average of 2.89 vs 1.57 children per woman elsewhere) is a raw gap of **+1.31** (M1). Under lagged economic controls (log GDP-PPP, urbanisation, remittances, under-5 mortality) with year fixed effects and country-clustered standard errors, the premium narrows to **+0.97** (M2) and to **+0.96** in the Mundlak hybrid specification (M2h), the primary specification. Both the pooled and hybrid estimates remain statistically distinguishable from zero under the wild-cluster bootstrap, with the primary M2h result significant at the 5% level (bootstrap p = 0.033), not the 1% level. This attenuation is descriptive and is not interpreted as a causal decomposition. Muslim population share and female SMAM are strongly correlated bivariately with country-average fertility, but they cannot be empirically separated from broader Central Asian regional identity in the 14-country cross-section (r(CA, Muslim) ≈ 0.83). The cultural interpretation rests on the demographic literature, not on the cross-sectional regression.

- Author-computed from MICS6 women's microdata using the Hajnal (1953) formula: Belarus (2019), Georgia (2018), Kyrgyzstan (2018), Uzbekistan (2021–2022).
- Author-computed from the 2021 Russian Census (VPN-2020, Table 5): Russia.

## Method — Two-Layer Design

**Part 1 — Descriptive comparative** (`01`, `02`, `03`): TFR trend plots, bloc-mean comparisons, σ-convergence within groups (CV, plus absolute SD/IQR dispersion pooled and by bloc), β-convergence using three-year endpoint averages, a projection-sensitivity check on balanced samples, and a period-split analysis.

**Part 2 — Explanatory analysis** in two layers:

- **Layer A — between-country gap** (`15`): pooled OLS with year fixed effects and country-clustered SEs. Model 1 estimates the raw Central Asia premium; Model 2 adds lagged economic controls and reports the surviving conditional premium; Model 3 tests interactions (CA × remittances, CA × urbanisation, CA × GDP).
- **Layer B — within-country robustness** (`16`): two-way fixed effects (country + year), first-difference model, average ADF t-bar unit-root check (descriptive form, not the formal IPS test), and a residual AR(1) serial-correlation check. This layer assesses whether the results are sensitive to persistent levels, country effects, and common year effects.
- **Diagnostics** (`17`): VIF, Mundlak test (FE vs RE — replaces the classical Hausman, which is undefined in this sample), and the few-cluster caveat.
- **Cross-section** (`18`): country-average TFR regressed on cultural variables (Muslim share, SMAM, female schooling) to examine whether selected cultural and nuptiality indicators align descriptively with the between-country pattern and to test whether they can be separated from Central Asian regional status (n = 14).

## Run Order

Scripts are numbered by execution order. Run all from the repo root.

```
# Part 1 — descriptive
python analysis/01_clean_data.py
python analysis/02_trend_plots.py
python analysis/03_convergence.py

# Part 2 — data pipeline
python analysis/11_coverage_map.py
python analysis/12_build_panel.py
python analysis/13_build_crosssection.py
python analysis/14_descriptives.py

# Part 2 — models & diagnostics
python analysis/15_layerA_gap.py
python analysis/16_layerB_within.py
python analysis/17_diagnostics.py
python analysis/18_crosssection.py
python analysis/19_robustness.py
python analysis/20_results_table.py
```

Or simply: `python run_all.py`, which runs the above in order and stops at the
first script that fails.

**Optional maintenance — refreshing the World Bank snapshots:**

```
python analysis/10_fetch_wdi.py --refresh
```

The committed analysis reproduces from the frozen `data/raw/raw_wb_*.csv`
snapshots; this script is not part of the default run order because it
overwrites those snapshots with a live download from the World Bank API
(historical values are periodically revised, which would break reproducibility
of the committed results). Run it only when you deliberately want to refresh
the covariate data, then re-run the Part 2 pipeline from `12_build_panel.py`
onward.

**SMAM primary-data computations** (each updates `data/manual/cultural_vars.csv`
in place):

```
python analysis/compute_blr_smam.py
python analysis/compute_geo_smam.py
python analysis/compute_kgz_smam.py
python analysis/compute_uzb_smam.py
python analysis/compute_rus_smam.py
```

These are order-independent **relative to each other**, but since they mutate
`data/manual/cultural_vars.csv`, running any of them requires regenerating
`13_build_crosssection.py`, `18_crosssection.py`, `19_robustness.py` and
`20_results_table.py` afterward.

## Reproducibility Notes

- **Raw microdata files are not committed** (see `.gitignore` and `data/raw/README.md`). To reproduce the SMAM values you must download the MICS6 `.sav` files and the Russian census workbook yourself; instructions and URLs are in `data/raw/README.md`.
- **No interpolation is applied to any panel variable.** There are eight raw missing remittance cells (Uzbekistan 2000–2004, Tajikistan 2000–2001, Kyrgyzstan 2023); none are filled. Because the panel regressions use a 1-year lag, only seven of these cause additional estimation-sample loss beyond the universal year-2000 lag drop (Uzbekistan's five gaps drop its 2001–2005 lagged observations; Tajikistan's two drop its 2001–2002). Kyrgyzstan's missing 2023 value would only affect a 2024 lag, which falls outside the 2000–2023 study window, so it causes no additional sample loss.
- **Standard errors are clustered by country (14 clusters)** in all panel regressions. This is below the conventional safe threshold (~30–50); the few-cluster fragility is flagged in `data/processed/diagnostics_results.txt`.

## Key Outputs

- `data/processed/panel.csv` — the working panel (336 rows, 14 countries × 24 years)
- `data/processed/crosssection.csv` — country averages + cultural variables (14 rows)
- `data/processed/results_main_table.md` — assembled M1–M4 table (paste-ready)
- `data/processed/{layerA,layerB,diagnostics,crosssection}_results.txt` — regression outputs
- `figures/` — trend plots, coverage map, cross-section scatter
- `output/tables/tab_summary_stats.tex` — descriptive-statistics LaTeX table

## Install

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Tested on Python 3.12 (the pinned scipy 1.13.1 has no Python 3.13 wheel; use Python 3.12 for a clean install). All dependencies pinned in `requirements.txt`.

## Limitations

- **n = 14 for the cross-section** limits statistical power; results are reported as descriptive associations, not causal estimates.
- **Muslim share and SMAM are collinear** in this sample; SMAM loses individual significance once Muslim share is included, and the two variables cannot be fully disentangled with 14 observations.
- **Cluster-robust SEs may be anti-conservative** given only 14 clusters. Wild-cluster bootstrap (Rademacher) inference is reported for M1, M2, M2h, and the two interaction terms (`19_robustness.py`, section G), with exact 2^14 Rademacher enumeration for M2h's Central Asia coefficient.
- **SMAM temporal alignment is imperfect**: source-years range 2010–2022 across countries. This mixed-source, mixed-year approach follows the convention of the closest published literature (Dommaraju & Agadjanian 2008; Spoorenberg 2013, 2015; Kumo & Perugini 2024).
